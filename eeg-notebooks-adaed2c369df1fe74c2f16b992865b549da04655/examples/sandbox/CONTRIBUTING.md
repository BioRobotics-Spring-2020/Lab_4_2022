# Contributing

:tada::clinking_glasses:  First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::clinking_glasses:

Contributions are always welcome, no matter how small.

## Contributing Data

If you have collected some interesting data, we would love to add it to the official EEG Notebooks data sets.

To contribute your data, first make sure it is appropriately stored in the `data` folder. It should be stored in the structure `eeg-notebooks/data/%experiment/%type/subject%name/session%number`. Subject name should not conflict with any of the prexisting datasets in EEG notebooks.

[Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) with just the data you want to add (not the notebook). In the comments section of the pull request, please include the following information:
- Data collected
- Age of the subject
- Gender of the subject
- Right or left handedness of the subject
- Any interesting notes you collected during data collection or analysis

## Contributing Code

If you find a way to improve the EEG Notebooks repo, feel free to file a pull request so that we can share your improvements with everybody!

Here's a couple areas that we know could use improvement:
- Support for platform-specific issues (i.e. improving raw EEG plotting experience on Windows)
- Updating the [old EEG notebooks](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/eeg-notebooks/tree/master/old_notebooks) to the newer format, with more description of the experiment background and inclusion of the Muse LSL connection and stimulus presentation scripts

### Community

This project is maintained by the [NeuroTechX](http://www.neurotechx.com) community. Join our Slack to check out our #interactive-tutorial channel, where discussions about EEG101 take place.

If you're in the Toronto area, the NeuroTechTO community often gets together to work on EEG Notebooks and other cool neurotech projects :beers: :pizza:. The NeuroTechX Slack channel is a good place to stay aware of such things, as is the NeuroTechX newsletter, which you can sign up for [here](http://neurotechx.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=5124b2527cf13d913a8beeea3&id=3519c19837)
